          Nancy Bowne began her comedic career through the inspiration of
          popsicle sticks. Her family cracked jokes around the dining room
          table, so why couldn’t a two year old? Even better, a two year old
          with a speech impediment! Needless to say, her sense of humor hasn’t
          aged that much. Nancy has recently returned from a pilgrimage of
          founding Improvisational comedy in Spain through ‘study abroad;’
          apparently her humor didn’t translate well. Maybe she shouldn’t have
          tried to smuggle olive oil and chorizo ham across the ocean. When she
          isn’t performing improv comedy, she is a schedule-obsessed, recovering
          workaholic ripping up old t-shirts for ‘upcycling’ sewing projects,
          hiking, and collecting records she’ll take months to open randomly.
          Some future goals include owning a vespa and having a greenhouse.
