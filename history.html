        Mixed Signals began as a "filler" act for the ACT Monologue and Paired
        Scene competition in 1996. All College Theater called for proposals of
        ways to fill the time needed for the judges to pick the winners. Matt
        Chiappardi and Lyndsay (Schaeffer) Korbylo wrote the proposal, it was
        accepted and they held auditions. They were such a hit after that first
        performance that the ACT board suggested they keep going. The group
        began free shows on-campus as well as the occasional off-campus gig.

        As original members began to graduate, many continued to attend
        practices and be in the shows for a short while. Eventually, The Mixed
        Signals alumni decided to establish a professional branch of the group
        to perform paid gigs off-campus. After four years, the professional
        group broke up due to distance and life interruptions.

        But the on-campus group goes on! Currently performing on-campus shows
        about every month, The Mixed Signals continue to grow and hone their
        improv skills. They have also performed a few off-campus shows in
        Philadelphia with The Rare Bird Show and at the Delaware Improv and
        Sketch Comedy O'Festival, and have even created their own improv
        festival, R.O.C.K. (Rather Outrageous Comedy Kickout)!

            Every year, the Sigs create a design for the back of that year's

            the year. Check them out below!
