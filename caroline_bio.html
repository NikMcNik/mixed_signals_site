          Caroline Geoghegan is a senior English major pursuing a minor in
          creative writing. She initially joined the Mixed Signals during the
          fall of 2021 after realizing she needed a hobby other than buying
          clown dolls on eBay. When not 'proving, she can be found writing,
          playing Sudoku, and memorizing lore from Bethesda's hit series The
          Elder Scrolls. Her poetry has been previously published in Volume Four
          of Book of Matches and the 2022 Sigma Tau Delta Rectangle, two
          literary journals you should totally check out now. Her favorite
          number is 6 and her favorite word is 'esoteric'. She believes in
          gnomes and living life 'for the bit'. Don't ask her what she's doing
          after college unless you're offering her a job.
