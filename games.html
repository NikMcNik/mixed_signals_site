          <h2>True Confessions</h2>
          <p>
            Two cops grill a suspect on a crime that they committed. The
            guessing part? The suspect doesn't know what they did. The audience
            provides a crime, an accomplice, and a place that the suspect
            escaped to.

          <h2>Weird Newscasters</h2>
          <p>
            The local news station has hired a brand new co-anchor to work
            alongside the veteran anchor, meteorologist, and sports person. The
            kicker? The latter of the three have a group quirk that unify them,
            provided by the audience (For instance, they are all obsessedâ€‹ with
            deli meats.). It's the job of the co-anchor to guess what makes this
            news team so weird.

          <p>
            One Signal gives a press conference on a world-changing event,
            provided by the audience, without knowing what the event is. They
            try to guess what the event is, while answering questions from other
            troupe members which give clues as to the nature of the event.

            Mixed Signals will give a stirring eulogy to the recently-departed
            (can be real or fictional, and is provided by the audience). The bad
            news? The Signal has no idea who that person is. The rest of the
            Signals, sitting in the audience, help the Eulogizer along by
            shouting "Hallelujah!" when the Eulogizer says something correct,
            and shouting "HELL no!" when they say something incorrect.

            A Signal is hosting a party! Three other Signals, the guests,

            enter the party as the host tries to guess what their quirks are.

            Three Signals are given personality trait by the audience. The
            Single Signal asks questions to try and figure out each quirk, and
            pick the best (or at least the least awkward) person to go on a date

          <h2>Santa's Lap</h2>
          <p>
            A game for the holidays, based on the premise that three children
            with weird audience-provided quirks have come to ask Santa for
            something for Christmas. Santa's job is to guess each child's quirk.
            Santa has an elf nearby to give clues if Santa just doesn't get it.

            Similar to Santa's Lap, except sinners will be brought to Hell to
            sit on the Devil's lap (not really), as Satan tries to guess their
            sins. Satan's faithful imp will be present to serve drinks, provide
            witty banter, and give Satan clues if they don't seem to be getting
            it.

          <h2>Ding!</h2>
          <p>
            A normal two-person scene except that any line, action, or sound
            effect can be "ding!ed" (changed) at the whim of an off-stage
            performer.

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Time Warp</h2>
          <p>
            A two-person scene that can be moved backwards or forwards in
            time--to past or future events--by a Signal off-stage.
          </p>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>First Line, Last Line</h2>
          <p>
            The audience provides the first and last lines of a scene; the
            performers have to do the rest.
          </p>

          <h2>Five-Letter Word</h2>
          <p>
            Each line of this otherwise ordinary scene must start with the next
            letter of an audience-provided five-letter word. Example: WEEDS -We
            are in big trouble this time. -Even though we put the cap back on?
            -Evan, it wasn't screwed on all the way. You know how mom hates when
            her toothpaste dries out. -Do I ever! Last time we did that, she
            killed the cat! -Shame it was the neighbors cat.

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Waiting For Charlie</h2>
          <p>
            Two Signals stage start a scene and begin to describe "Charlie" (an
            offstage character that the audience hasn't seen yet), giving them
            strange physical, emotional, and personality characteristics (ex:
            has one arm, screams whenever someone says their name, and always
            makes terrible jokes). Eventually, "Charlie" joins the scene and it
            progresses from there.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Soap Opera</h2>
          <p>
            his game is a scene within a scene. The audience gives a "first
            world problem" (for instance, when you run out of paper clips), and
            the scene is either played super-dramatically, or the problem serves
            as a euphemism for a more serious issue. Drama abounds. Example One:
            Running out of paper clips, but as dramatic as if the paper clips
            kept the Earth spinning. Example Two: Performing a scene about a
            deflated balloon AS IF performing a scene about impotence.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Oscar Winning Moment</h2>
          <p>
            Two Signals act out a scene, while a third serves as a "DJ" and
            pre-selects three instrumentals (usually) of any genre. At any point
            in the scene, a Signal will ding, and the DJ plays one of the songs,
            with the acting Signals changing the mood of the scene to match.
            When the song ends--determined by the DJ--the Signals snap back to
            the mood before the song was played.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>2-3-4-5</h2>
          <p>
            In this game, the audience suggests a word that can be used in
            multiple ways (such as "space" or "bat"). Two performers start the
            scene using that word. At some point in that scene, the next
            performer will freeze the scene, and the two on stage will return to
            a neutral position as the new performer creates a new, three-person
            scene based off that word. This continues until a five-person scene
            is performed. Then, in reverse order, performers will leave the
            scene. The scenes progress backwards through the scenes already
            performed until it gets back to the original two-person scene, which
            ends the game.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Hollywood Director</h2>
          <p>
            In this game, one Signal is the eponymous "director," and the other
            three are their actors. With an audience suggestion, the director
            comes up with a scene for the performers to act out. At some point
            in this scene, the Director will "cut' the scene, and add a
            twist--for example, "Do the same scene, but act like you're on
            fire." Usually, three twists will be added, cumulatively or
            otherwise, before the scene is "perfect."
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Continuation</h2>
          <p>
            This game involves two pairs of performers. The first pair starts
            the scene and when a Signal off-stage rings the bell, the second
            pair takes their place and continues the scene as the same
            characters where it left off. They continue to switch back and
            forth, often with greater frequency as the action in the scene
            heightens.

        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>La Ronde</h2>
          <p>
            The namesake of L'Swipe, this is a game for four Signals. Two
            Signals start a normal scene from a word, but at some point, one
            leaves. From there, the third Signal enters the scene, and has a
            scene with the second Signal, who keeps the same character and
            location. Then the second Signal leaves, the fourth enters, and so
            on, until the fourth Signal and the first (still playing the same
            character from the beginning) have a short "button" to end the game.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>L'Swipe</h2>
          <p>
            This is a long-form game in which an audience member gives a word
            that then inspires a montage of scenes. A scene can be "swiped"
            (stopped) and a new scene can be started in its place or it can be
            "frozen" (another person can enter the scene). One of our longer
            games.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Crazy-Prov</h2>
          <p>
            This is a game that involves any and every improv game there is
            (mostly). Starting with L'Swipe, a scene is performed. At any time,
            a Signal can ding to make a performer change their line (a la
            Ding!), to change their emotion (a la emotion game), to change the
            genre (a la FATS), to change the "that time" (a la Time Warp), and a
            host of other wacky twists. And it continues to change until we
            (hopefully) have a fully-developed scene with lots of sudden
            changes. It's CRAZY IMPROV!!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>No Minor Characters</h2>
          <p>
            A scene goes on as usual, but if a character leaves the scene, the
            scene follows that character. Another longer game. Ex: There is a
            party going on. The host leaves the living room to get more punch.
            Then, the scene moved to the kitchen, with the host getting punch
            (no longer at the party).

          <h2>FATS (Film and Theater Styles)</h2>
          <p>
            A two-person scene starts as normal, but is changed to different
            film and theater styles (drama, MTV, horror, western, etc.) as the
            scene progresses at the whim of the Signals in the back. So, a scene
            about building a house could suddenly turn into a horror film, and
            then a cooking show. Suggestions are gathered from the audience
            before the show.

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Family Vacation</h2>
          <p>
            The Mixed Signals went on a trip to (audience suggestion). Two host
            Signals describe to the audience each picture in their
            scrapbook/PowerPoint/evidence folder, and the rest of the Signals
            silently pose to demonstrate what is described in each picture.
            Action is allowed in the case of "videos" or "flip-books."

        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Pull the Line</h2>
          <p>
            A two-person scene goes on as usual except, at any point in the
            scene, a Signal will pull a line from their pocket and use it in the
            scene. The lines are all audience suggestions gathered before the
            show.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Three Line Scene</h2>
          <p>
            A three-person scene in which two of the Signals are only allowed to
            say three lines each (a question, a statement, and an exclamation
            suggested by the audience) while the third Signal has to make it all
            work on their own!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Number of Words</h2>
          <p>
            Similar to Three Line Scene, but instead of giving specific phrases,
            the two Signals are given a number from one to five, and only
            allowed to use that many words per line. So if someone had the
            number "two," they could say "Good job!" but not "You did well!" or
            "Great!"
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Emotion Game</h2>
          <p>
            A two-person scene in which one performer embodies that emotion more
            and more whenever the bell rings (the bell is dung at the whim of
            the Signals). There are also special, holiday-specific games such as
            Monster Game (Halloween), and Love Game (Valentine's Day)
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Questions Only</h2>
          <p>
            This game involves exactly what you'd expect: questions only! The
            Signals stand in the back as two at a time step up and perform a
            "talking heads" scene, but they're only allowed to ask questions.
            The performers rotate in and out as Signals mess up and don't ask
            questions.

        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Alphabet Game</h2>
          <p>
            A game similar in layout to Questions Only, but the Signals start
            each line with a letter of the alphabet and have to make their way
            through from there. Signals switch out as the two in front mess up.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>World's Worst</h2>
          <p>
            All performers stand in a line and answer the question "What is the
            world's worst _____?" The suggestions are gathered from the audience
            before the show.

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Half Life</h2>
          <p>
            A normal two-person scene is performed in two minutes. The same
            scene is then performed in one minute, then thirty seconds, and then
            fifteen seconds, trying to get all the events in and beat the clock.
            One Signal usually serves as a walk-on in the halfway point of each
            scene to serve as a "time check" for the two main Signals.

        <div class="info">
          <h2>What the F***, Chuck?</h2>
          <p>
            This is a game for four Signals. The first two act out a scene from
            a word while the other two listen to loud music in the back of the
            room. After the first scene, the second pair try to recreate the
            scene based the original blocking and gestures. This rarely goes as
            planned.

          <h2>Gbugly (The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly)</h2>
          <p>
            One Signal serves as a host for a fantastic advice-giving creation,
            with three Signals each serving as the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
            The host takes questions from the audience, with each part of the
            creation answering the question in-character: the Good is earnest,
            the Bad is crass, and the Ugly is ... ugly. After each question the
            Signals, minus the host, swap places to act as the next character.

        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>Oracle</h2>
          <p>
            Similar to Gbugly in that a host takes questions from the audience,
            but three Signals instead form a machine known as the "Oracle": one
            Signal kneeling, one sitting behind them on a chair, and one
            standing behind the second. Starting with the Signal in the back,
            each part of the Oracle helps answer the question, one word at a
            time. Known as "Menorahcle" for the Holiday Show.

          <h2>Hey, You Down There!</h2>
          <p>
            This is a game for four Signals, who work together to put together a
            scene demonstrating an action or profession, in the style of cheesy
            1950s infomercials. One Signal serves as the "narrator," giving
            direction to two other Signals, who silently act out what the
            narrator has them do. A final Signal acts as the DJ, playing 50s-era
            commercial music to add to the scene.

          <h2>Challenge!</h2>
          <p>
            Four Signals line up on stage and are given a topic by the audience.
            One of them will step forward and talk about the topic (even if they
            don't know about it and are making it up). At any point, another
            Signal can shout "Challenge!" and challenge one or all of the
            "facts" just stated. A host will then decide who is "right," and
            that person will continue until he or she is challenged by someone
            else. Whoever is in front when the two-minute timer runs out is the
            "winner."

          <h2>Thanksgiving Game</h2>
          <p>
            A once-a-year long-form game, played at our Thanksgiving Show. An
            audience member is grilled about their Thanksgiving traditions and
            about members of their family that would usually be present. The
            Signals then perform the audience member's typical Thanksgiving,
            acting as members of their family.
