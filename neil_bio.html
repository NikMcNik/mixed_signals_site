          Communication Studies RTF major at TCNJ and publicist of the Mixed
          Signals, Neil Scuzzese ( NEEL scu-ZAY-zee) is an aspiring filmmaker
          and head-strong creative visionary. His hobbies include writing short
          stories, drawing, brainstorming creative endeavors, photography, and
          spending time with friends and family. Neil is also an avid lover of
          animals and nature, with many of his short stories being
          animal-centered. Before improv comedy, Neil had never auditioned for
          anything, let alone been in the performing arts, so the idea was
          rightfully frightening but at the same time, thrilling. Joining the
          Mixed Signals has had one of the biggest impacts on him, allowing him
          to grow his confidence and be himself in front of the world. As his
          college journey continues, so will his ambition to achieve his goals,
          encouraging others to take that frightening step into new territory as
          he did and will continue to do.
